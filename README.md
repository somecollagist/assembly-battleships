# assembly-battleships
A simple version of battleships, written in x86 real mode.

## Why I made this (twice)
When I was 17, preparing for my A-Levels next year, the CS department at my school chose to give us the prerelease of this year's exams to practice with. This ended up being an implementation of battleships written in C#.

It was bad. *Really* bad.

Determined to prove not only that the code AQA gave its entrants was poor, but to prove my own skills as a developer, I set out on a mission: create a version of battleships in x86 real-mode assembly. Turns out, being a nerd has its perks, and after a few evenings, I had a decent little version working, all fitting neatly inside a boot sector with room to spare.

Three years later, now at university, I was reminded of this project by an assignment. This repository serves as the product of a fun mental exercise (and so I hopefully don't lose the code again...)
